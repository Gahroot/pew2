 * pew2 — mobile remote for coding agents.

 * One screen. The provider list, the greeting and the conversation are states
 * of the same surface rather than separate pages, so the composer never moves
 * and a prompt can be typed before an agent is even chosen.
 *
 * The approval sheet is the reason this app exists, so it is a blocking,
 * unmissable surface rather than an inline row that can scroll away.
