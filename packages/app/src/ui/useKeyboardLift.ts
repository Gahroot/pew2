 * perfect step. No JS re-render can land halfway through and move things a
 * second time.
 *
 * A transform, deliberately, not a height. The thread is a recycling list, and
 * `RecyclerView` answers any container resize with a full layout pass in JS — so
 * shortening the pane per frame queued sixty of them across the keyboard's
 * animation, which is the stutter. Translating moves the same pixels on the UI
 * thread and lays out nothing.
 *
 * Cross-platform by construction rather than by branch: `useKeyboardHandler`
 * calls the library's `useResizeMode`, which sets Android to `adjustResize`, and
 * `KeyboardProvider` puts it in edge-to-edge — a pairing that stops Android
 * resizing the window at all. So on both platforms nothing but this transform
 * moves, and neither needs a `softwareKeyboardLayoutMode` in app.json.
 *
 * The keyboard is measured from the physical screen edge, so the home-indicator
 * clearance the dock keeps is handed back while it is open, and the composer
 * keeps the same gap above either boundary.
 *
 * @returns `pane` for bottom-anchored content, `centred` to cancel half of it,
 *   `progress` (0 closed to 1 open) for content that reacts to typing.

      // real position, sampled per frame. But it is *not guaranteed to arrive*.
      // iOS 26 stopped delivering those frames to release builds: the library
      // finds the keyboard by walking the window hierarchy for private UIKit
      // class names (`UIInputSetHostView` and friends) and driving a
      // `CADisplayLink` off the view it finds, and when that lookup comes back
      // empty there is no per-frame anything. `onStart`/`onEnd` still fire,
      // because those are ordinary keyboard notifications. So the pane sat
      // still for the whole animation and then snapped — in TestFlight only,
      // while every development build looked perfect, which is exactly the
      // shape of the bug that was so maddening to chase.

      // system says the keyboard will take, so the pane covers the same
      // distance in the same time whether or not a single frame is ever
      // reported. When they are reported, the assignment in `onMove` simply
      // takes over — assigning to a shared value cancels whatever animation is
