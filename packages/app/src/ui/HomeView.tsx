                    mismatch, so "Connecting..." would loop forever while
                    telling the one person who can act nothing at all.

                    Then the quieter version of the same failure. A pairing the
                    machine rejects below the socket — 401 from the daemon, 409
                    from a relay room with no machine in it — sends no frame to
                    explain itself, so retrying continues in the background
                    while the words stop pretending it is nearly there.

                    Deliberately not a checklist. By far the commonest reason
                    this shows is that the phone has no signal, and the machine
                    is fine — so instructions to go and inspect it are wrong
                    advice most of the times they are read, and unfollowable
                    anyway from wherever the user is standing. What can be done
                    from here is keep typing, which the composer now says. */
