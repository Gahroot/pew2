/**
 * The Skia plumbing shared by everything that records a picture per frame on
 * the UI thread (Pew, the goal launch, the thinking dial).
 *
 * Why it exists: React Native Skia (2.2) files every Skia object a worklet
 * touches into one global table per runtime, and that table has no lock. An
 * object made on the JS thread, drawn on the UI thread and later garbage
 * collected on the JS thread is removed from the UI runtime's table *from the
 * JS thread*, while the UI thread is adding the objects of the next frame.
 * Two threads in one hash table: the app crashed in
 * `RuntimeLifecycleMonitor::addListener` (EXC_BAD_ACCESS on the main thread).
 *
 * So: the blank picture every painter starts from is made once and never
 * freed, and a frame reuses one recorder and one bounds rectangle instead of
 * making new ones, which also keeps the table from churning by hundreds of
 * entries a second.
 *
 * That could not close the race on its own: every declarative `<Canvas>` makes
 * recorders of its own, and Hermes frees those on its background GC thread
 * (crash in `removeListener` on thread "hades"). Skia 2.3.8 put a mutex on the
 * table, which is why the app is pinned at 2.3.14 rather than Expo SDK 54's
 * suggested 2.2.12; do not go back below 2.3.8. The reuse above stays, for the
 * churn.
