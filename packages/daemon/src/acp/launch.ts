/**
 * How to actually launch what `findOnPath` found.
 *
 * On POSIX, unchanged: the command is spawned as given.
 *
 * On Windows, two things are true that are not true anywhere else. The command
 * has to be resolved to a real file first — libuv only ever appends `.com` and
 * `.exe`, so a bare `npx` never finds the `npx.cmd` that npm actually installed.
 * And since CVE-2024-27980 (Node 18.20.2 / 20.12.2 / 21.7.3) spawning a `.cmd`
 * or `.bat` without a shell is refused outright with EINVAL, because argument
 * quoting for those is a command-injection surface.
 *
 * So a batch shim goes through `cmd.exe` explicitly — never `shell: true`, which
 * hands an unescaped line to a parser and is the vulnerability itself.
 *
 * The escaping is not optional decoration. Passing the parts as ordinary argv
 * entries looks right and is wrong: Node quotes them MSVCRT-style, then `/s`
 * strips the *first and last* quote of everything after `/c` — which unquotes
 * the program path. `C:\Program Files\nodejs\npx.cmd`, the default location of
 * the launcher five bundled providers run through, would split at the space and
 * fail with a syntax error nobody could act on. So the line is built here,
 * escaped for both parsers, and handed over verbatim — the same shape npm,
 * nodemon and cross-spawn all settled on.
