/**
 * Files a phone attaches to a new goal.

 * days and daemon restarts. So they go under pew2's own home directory, never
 * the tempdir (which the OS clears) and never the project (where `git add .`
 * would commit them). Same limits and the same name sanitising as attachments:
 * a name off a phone is a label, not a path.
